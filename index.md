Hi, I'm Terence. I'm [passionate about open-source](https://github.com/terencechain) and have been actively involved in Ethereum protocol development since late 2018. Recently, I joined Offchain Labs where I've delved into L2 research.

## Highlights

### Ethereum
- Maintainer of [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm), an Ethereum consensus layer client developed in Go.
- Contributed to Ethereum's [Consensus Specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs), [MEV-Boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost), and [Builder Specs](https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs).

#### Publications
I periodically contribute to Hackmd, Ethresearch, and Substack:
- [Optimizing Interactions Between Ethereum Consensus & Execution Clients](https://substack.com/home/post/p-140705743?source=queue)
- [Validator Timing Game Post EIP-4844](https://ethresear.ch/t/validator-timing-game-post-eip4844/18129)
- [Forward Inclusion List](https://ethresear.ch/t/specing-out-forward-inclusion-list-w-dedicated-gas-limits/17115)
- [Writing an Ethereum Consensus Client: Lessons & Future](https://substack.com/home/post/p-139182302?source=queue)
- [Navigating Ethereum's 2024 Consensus Landscape](https://substack.com/home/post/p-137196839?source=queue)
- [Reducing Prysm Proposer Slot 0 Propose Time by 800ms](https://hackmd.io/lWq6jEVhThy72CnAkpTvig)

### L2 Research
- Worked on permissionless fraud proofs with [BoLD](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/BOLDChallengeProtocol.pdf) and its [implementation](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold).

#### Sequencing Thoughts
- Explored some ideas on [Sequencing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIrz1Rk-hmo&pp=ygUeZGVjZW50cmFsaXplZCBzZXF1ZW5jaW5nIGV0aGNj).
